Paper Link: https://doi.org/10.1109/NCIM59001.2023.10212766

Abstract: The research aims to contribute to the accumulation of store earnings by providing insights into the intentions of online shoppers, ultimately assisting in the development of more targeted and effective online marketing strategies.

Project Goal:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning classification system capable of predicting the intention of online shoppers (whether they will make a purchase or not) by analyzing the values of the provided attributes. Several classification algorithms are evaluated to choose the most suitable one for the job.

Data Set Information:

The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions. The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.

Conclusion:
This study examined internet shopping intentions and behavior. The results imply that the Theory of Planned Behavior understands these elements. In this paper, we propose a system based on the SVM, NBC, RF, GB, LR, AdaBoost, KNN Confusion matrix, and (Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney rank test, Chi-square test, Levene's test) algorithm to forecast e-commerce platform users' buy intentions based on browsing data.
